Hello!

For over 12 years, I've been passionately creating and delivering software systems,
 working on projects/products using a variety of technologies ranging from basic
 standalone apps to majestic monoliths and highly scalable micro-services.

I enjoy working on complicated systems, improving their designs, empowering users,
 and providing strong technical leadership to a team.

When working on a project, I'm primarily concerned with direction, performance,
 quality, extensibility, maintainability, simplicity, and usability.

As a Freelance Software Engineer based in Pune, ***I am open to remote or hybrid work***.
