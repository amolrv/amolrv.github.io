Hello!

I'm a software engineer who has been working on commercial projects since 2012.
Along the way I have been very lucky to learn from outstanding people and work with them on the exciting projects.

These days I'm focused on product design and building leadership skills atÂ [Layer](https://golayer.io/).

If you want to talk about software or ask a question, don't hesitate to reach out on [twitter](https://twitter.com/amol_vyawhare).
I'm learning a lot from the smart and kind people around the world. I'd be glad to help out someone as well.

> In case if you want to hire me reach out me on [linkedin](https://linkedin.com/in/amol){:target="_blank"} or check out my [resume](/resume/){:target="_blank"}.
