Hello!

If you want to talk about software or ask a question, don't hesitate to reach out on [twitter](https://twitter.com/amol_vyawhare).

I'm learning a lot from the smart and kind people around the world. I'd be glad to help out someone as well.

## About Me

I'm a software engineer who has been working on commercial projects since 2012.
Along the way I have been very lucky to learn from outstanding people and work with them on the exciting projects.

These days I'm focused on product design and building leadership skills atÂ [Layer](https://golayer.io/).
