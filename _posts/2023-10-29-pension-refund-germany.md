If you're an Indian who has worked in Germany for a short term (less than 5 years) and wondering how to get your pension contributions back, this guide will help you navigate the process.

## Eligibility for Refund

To be eligible for a pension refund, you must meet all of these criteria:

- [x] You haven't qualified for a German retirement pension yet (qualification requires 60 monthly contributions)
- [x] At least 24 months have passed since your last contribution
- [x] You are no longer residing in the EU

For detailed information, you can refer to [the Social Security Agreement between Germany and India](https://www.deutsche-rentenversicherung.de/SharedDocs/Downloads/DE/Broschueren/international/weitere_abkommen_fremdsprachig/arbeiten_deutschland_indien_englische%20_fassung.pdf?__blob=publicationFile&v=1){:target="_blank"}

## How much refund can you get?

You'll receive a refund of your employee contributions (your part of the payments). You can find your contribution amounts in your annual tax certificate (`Lohnsteuerbescheinigung für <Year>`).

For a rough estimate, you can use this formula:

```text
Refund = Average gross monthly salary * number of months worked * 9.3/100
```

Note: This is a simplified calculation. The actual refund amount may vary due to factors like contribution caps on high salaries and other variables.
