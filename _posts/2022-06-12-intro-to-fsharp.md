I stumbled upon [F#]{:target="\_blank"} in around 2017.
At that time I was new in [ThoughtWorks]{:target="\_blank"}.
It was overwhelming experience just by sheer size of learning on day to day
basis. I was in the organization where folks out of TW universities has
distilled knowledge of person working in software field for 5-6 years.

## What is it? 🤔

During that time TW used to provide 3 problem statements for take-a-home
assignment and applicant can choose any language that they are comfortable.
Until that point I had only experience with [.NET]{:target="\_blank"} hence
I completed code challenge in `C#` and submitted.

The next step was pair programming. After pair programming
[Krunal]{:target="\_blank"} asked me one question before sharing feedback.

> do you know functional programming?

I said no, what is it?. He was surprised by answer as my most of the code was
written in functional style and was heavily based on
`IEnumerable/IQueryable` and `Extensions`.

## do you know fsharp?

Fast forward after 10-12 months being in TW, I was having some conversations
with [Mushtaq]{:target="\_blank"} and when I talked him about my past
experience with [.NET]{:target="\_blank"}, first thing that he asked was
_"do you know [fsharp][F#]?"_. At that moment I decided to learn fsharp.
