I stumbled upon [F#]{:target="_blank"} around 2017.
At that time, I was new at [ThoughtWorks]{:target="_blank"}.
It was an overwhelming experience, just by the sheer amount of learning on a day-to-day basis. I was in an organization where folks out of TW universities had distilled the knowledge of someone working in the software field for 5-6 years.

## What is it? 🤔

During that time, TW used to provide three problem statements for the take-home assignment, and applicants could choose any language they were comfortable with.
Until that point, I had only experience with [.NET]{:target="_blank"}, so I completed the code challenge in `C#` and submitted it.

The next step was pair programming. After pair programming,
[Krunal]{:target="_blank"} asked me one question before sharing feedback.

> Do you know functional programming?

I said no, what is it? He was surprised by my answer, as most of my code was written in a functional style and was heavily based on
`IEnumerable/IQueryable` and `Extensions`.

## Do you know fsharp?

Fast forward 10-12 months into TW, I was having some conversations
with [Mushtaq]{:target="_blank"}, and when I told him about my past
experience with [.NET]{:target="_blank"}, the first thing he asked was
_"Do you know [fsharp][F#]?"_. At that moment, I decided to learn fsharp.
