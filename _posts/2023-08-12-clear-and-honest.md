When working with a huge code base, it's common to forget how a specific code block (function, method, or class) is implemented. However, the IDE suggests using a signature. Sometimes calling a code block can come with unpleasant shocks. By creating honest and clear code blocks, this can be prevented.

For example:

```kotlin
// (account: Account, amount : BigDecimal) -> Account
fun credit(account: Account, amount : BigDecimal): Account {
  if(amount < ZERO) throw NegativeAmountError(amount)
  return account.copy(balance = account.balance + amount)
}
```

By looking at the signature, caller simply does't know that it's going to blow up. This kind of code blocks affect engineer in 2 ways
1. Increases cognitive overload as caller has to read and understand the code block before using it.
2. hampers the trust.

Honest signature could have been something like
```kotlin
(account: Account, amount : NonNegativeCurrency) -> Account
// or
(account: Account, amount : BigDecimal) -> Either<NegativeAmountError, Account>
```

These 2 signatures appear quite straightforward, yet they use 2 different techniques.

- The first signature prevents entry into an incorrect state by forbidding negative input.
- While allowing erroneous input, the second signature communicates output more precisely. It informs the caller that it may provide an error or credit to their account.
