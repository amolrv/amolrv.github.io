The more I think about programming, the more I see Lego. There is a reason for that. I usually try to break things down to atomic levels, to the point where they can't be broken down any further.
In my childhood, I used to do the same with toys‚Äîpull out each piece and then put it back.

So when I apply the same approach to programming, two things happen:

1. I create a lot of small pieces that can't be broken down any further
2. I get enormous flexibility in building new things out of them
