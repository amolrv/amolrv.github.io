The more I think about programming, the more I see lego. There is reason to that. I usually try to break down things to atomic levels from which it can't be broken down into small things.
In my childhood I used to do same with toy, pull out each piece and then put it back.

So when I apply same things for programming, 2 things happens

1. I creates lot of small pieces that can't be broken down  into smaller anymore
2. I get enormous flexibility of building new things out it.
