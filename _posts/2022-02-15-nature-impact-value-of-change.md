In this article, I'm sharing lessons and learnings about change. Understanding the **nature, impact, and value of change** brought more clarity and confidence, and helped me prepare a release plan.

## Situation ðŸ§º

Like my other colleagues, I have also been part of such a _Taskforce_ a couple of times. But recently, in my task force, it was becoming very hard to come up with a proper release plan. We were struggling to make a release plan that could be delivered _incrementally_ and _iteratively_.

## Background ðŸ“œ

### What is a Taskforce? ðŸ¤”

At [layer](https://golayer.io/about/){:target="_blank"}, we form a triplet of _Tech, Product, and Business_ to refine featuresâ€”usually one person from each area. Sometimes, the Product Owner represents business expertise or acts as a proxy for business. For each epic, people rotate from each area. This helps create opportunities to learn, grow, and avoid biases in the company. We call such a triplet a _Taskforce_.

The task force has the following responsibilities ðŸ’ª

- Refine features (aka epics)
- Be a point of contact for all QA during crunch time
- Prepare the release plan

## Still, the picture was not very clear ðŸ§ 

We had a few brainstorming meetings, but the picture was still not very clear in our heads. So I decided to analyze this epic critically and come up with some options.

## What we did ðŸ¤ž

I decided to start from a clean slate and look at this feature from the user's point of view. To do that, I asked the following questions for each concept and change we wanted to bring in:

1. What problem does it solve for the user?
2. What problem might it create for the user?
3. What is the nature of these changes?

- Breaking change â€“ if it breaks or changes an existing concept/feature drastically and affects user flow
- New change â€“ if there were no such concepts before in the system; may or may not affect user flow
- Enhancement â€“ changes that refine existing concepts but not so drastically, and may not affect user flow

After doing this analysis and spending a few hours, I realized more than 70% of changes were either enhancements or new changes, and ~30% were breaking changes. Just doing this analysis unblocked a very big chunk of features and brought a ton of clarity to my head.

For breaking changes, I did one extra step: I asked the same three questions for an existing feature to gain more clarity. After that, I knew exactly what we were taking out and giving back to the user. Now it was very easy to spot and fill the gaps.

In summary, understanding the nature, impact, and value of incoming changes is very useful in shaping the overall plan.
