In this article, I'm sharing lessons and learning about change. How understanding the **nature, impact and value of change** resulted in more clarity and confidence and helped me to prepare a release plan.

## Situation ðŸ¤º
Like my other colleagues, I also have been part of such *Taskforce* a couple of times. But recently in my task force, it was becoming very hard to come up with a proper release plan. We're struggling to make a release plan which can be delivered *incrementally* and *iteratively*.

## Background ðŸ“œ

### What is a Taskforce? ðŸ¤”
At [layer](https://golayer.io/about/), we form a triplet of *Tech, Product and Business* to refine features. Mostly one person from each area. Sometimes Product owner represents business expertise or acts as a proxy for business. For each epic people rotates from each area. This helps to create opportunities to learn, grow and avoid biases in the company. We called such a triplet *Taskforce*.

The task force has the following responsibility ðŸ’ª
- Refine feature aka epic
- Be a point of contact for all the QA during crunch time.
- Prepare release plan

## Still, the picture was not very clear in ðŸ§ 

We had a few brainstorming meetings but still picture was not very clear in our head; so I decided to analyse this epic critically and come up with some options.

## What we did ðŸ¤ž

I decided to start from a clean slate and look at this feature from the user's point of view. To do that I asked the following question for each concept and change that we wanted to bring in.
1. *What problem does it solves for the user?*
2. *What problem it might create for the user?*
3. *What is the nature of these changes?*
	- *Breaking change* - if it *breaks or changes existing concept/feature drastically* and *changes affects user flow*.
	-  *New change* - there were *no such concepts that existed before* in the system and it *may or may not affect user flow*.
	-  *Enhancement* - changes refine existing concepts* but not so drastically and may not affect user flow.

After doing this analysis and spending a few hours, I realised more than 70 % of changes were either enhancement or new changes and ~ 30 % were breaking changes. Just doing analysis unblocked a very big chunk of features and it brings a ton of clarity to my head.

For breaking changes, I did one extra step I asked the same 3 questions for an existing feature to gain more clarity. After that, I knew exactly what we were taking out and giving back to the user. Now it was very easy to spot and fill the gaps.

In summary

>I learned that understanding *nature*, *impact* and *value* it brings to the user are very crucial aspects.
